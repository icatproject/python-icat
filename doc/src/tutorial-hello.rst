Hello World!
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimal task to start any program environment is to print a simple
message.  The minimal interaction with an ICAT server is to connect to
it and get its version.  We'll combine both in a simple program:

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorial/hello.py

If you run this script, you should get something like the following as
output::

  $ python hello.py
  Connect to https://icat.example.com:8181
  ICAT version 4.10

The constructor of :class:`icat.client.Client` takes the URL of the
ICAT service as argument.  It contacts the ICAT server, queries the
version and stores the result to the attribute
:attr:`~icat.client.Client.apiversion` of the client object.
Obviously, you'll need to change the variable `url` in this example to
point to your ICAT server.

If your ICAT server does not have a trusted SSL certificate you may
get an error instead::

  $ python hello.py
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:548)>

In this case, you may either install a trusted certificate in your
server now or modify your hello program and add a flag
``checkCert=False`` to the constructor call like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorial/hello-nocert.py

The class :class:`icat.client.Client` plays the central role in
python-icat programs.  Most of your code will deal with objects of
this class.  For this reason, the class is imported by default in the
:mod:`icat` package.  The above example could also be written as:

.. literalinclude:: ../tutorial/hello-client.py
