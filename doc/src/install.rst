Install instructions
====================

Release packages of python-icat are published in the `Python Package
Index (PyPI)`__.  See :ref:`install-using-pip` for the short version
of the install instructions.

.. __: `PyPI site`_


System requirements
-------------------

Python
......

+ 3.4 and newer.

Required library packages
.........................

The following packages are required to install and use python-icat.
They will automatically be installed as dependencies if you install
using pip.

+ `setuptools`_

+ `packaging`_

+ :ref:`suds`, see below.

Optional library packages
.........................

These packages are only needed to use certain extra features.  They
are not required to install python-icat and use its core features:

+ `PyYAML`_

  Only needed to use the YAML backend of :ref:`icatdump` and
  :ref:`icatingest` and to run the example scripts.

+ `lxml`_

  Only needed to use the XML backend of :ref:`icatdump` and
  :ref:`icatingest`.

+ `setuptools_scm`_

  The version number is managed using this package.  All source
  distributions add a static text file with the version number and
  fall back using that if setuptools_scm is not available.  So this
  package is only needed to build out of the plain development source
  tree as cloned from GitHub.

+ `pytest`_ >= 3.1.0

  Only if you want to run the tests.

+ `pytest-dependency`_ >= 0.2

  Only if you want to run the tests.

+ `distutils-pytest`_

  Only if you want to run the tests.

.. _suds:

Suds
....

Suds is a lightweight SOAP-based web service client for Python.  The
original version was written by Jeff Ortel, but is not maintained
since very long time and does not work anymore.  There are several
forks around, most of them short-lived.  Two of them have been
evaluated with python-icat and found to work: `suds-jurko`_, the fork
by Jurko GospodnetiÄ‡ and the more recent `suds-community`_.  The
latter has officially been renamed back to suds since version 1.0.0.

Note that suds-community does not work with ICAT server 4.8.0 and
older, see `Issue #72`_ for details.  So you'd need to use suds-jurko
when you need to talk to those older ICAT servers.  On the other hand,
suds-jurko does not seem to be maintained any more and can not be
installed with setuptools 58.0.0 and newer.

When you install python-icat using pip, suds-community will be
installed as a dependency by default.  If you want to use any other
Suds clone you need to install it first in a separate step, before
installing python-icat.  E.g. do something like the following if you
want to use python-icat with suds-jurko::

  $ pip install suds-jurko
  $ pip install python-icat


Installation
------------

.. _install-using-pip:

Installation using pip
......................

You can install python-icat from PyPI using pip::

  $ pip install python-icat

Installation from the source distribution
.........................................

Steps to manually build from the source distribution:

1. Download the sources, unpack, and change into the source directory.

2. Build::

     $ python setup.py build

3. Test (optional, see below)::

     $ python setup.py test

4. Install::

     $ python setup.py install

The last step might require admin privileges in order to write into
the site-packages directory of your Python installation.

Building from development sources
.................................

For production use, it is always recommended to use the latest release
version from PyPI, see above.  If you need some not yet released
bleeding edge feature or if you want to participate in the
development, you may also clone the `source repository from GitHub`__.

Note that some source files are dynamically created and thus missing
in the development sources.  If you want to build from the development
sources, you may use the provided Makefile.  E.g. type ``make build``,
``make test``, and ``make sdist``.

.. __: `GitHub repository`_


Test
----

There is no need to run the tests at all.  The test suite is mostly
useful to the maintainer of python-icat.

Most tests require a test ICAT server to talk to.  These tests are
disabled by default, unless you configure such a test server.  To do
so, place an icat.cfg file into tests/data.  This file must have at
least the configuration sections "root", "useroffice", "acord",
"ahau", "jbotu", "jdoe", "nbour", and "rbeck" with the options and
credentials to access the test server as the respective user.  See
doc/examples for an example.  Obviously, this implies that your
authentication plugin must also have these users configured.

**WARNING**: the tests are destructive!  They will delete all content
from the test server and replace it with example content.  Do not
configure the tests to access a production server!

You can safely run the tests without configuring any test server.  You
will just get many skipped tests then.
