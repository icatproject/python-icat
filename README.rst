python-icat – Python interface to ICAT and IDS
==============================================

This package provides a collection of modules for writing Python
programs that access an `ICAT`_ service using the SOAP interface.  It
is based on Suds and extends it with ICAT specific features.

The latest release version can be found in the
`Python Package Index (PyPI)`__.

Documentation
-------------

See the `online documentation`__.

Example scripts can be found in doc/examples.  This is mostly an
unsorted collection of test scripts that I initially wrote for myself
to try things out.

Almost all scripts use example_data.yaml as input for test data.  Of
course for real production, the input will come from different
sources, out of some workflow from the site.  But this would be
dynamic and site specific and thus not suitable, neither for testing
nor for the inclusion into example scripts.  So its easier to have
just one blob of dummy input data in one single file.  That is also
the reason why the example scripts require PyYAML.
